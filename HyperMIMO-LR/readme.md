To run the model:

  1. In H_regularizer_params.zip are the matrices that we used in the regularizer (matrices + parameters of MMNet). You need to unzip
  2. Run python train_model.py. This will save the model (if you want to change the name of path, just change it)
  3. Run test_model.py to generate the result of Fig. 3 (a)
  4. Move to the main folder to run plot's jupyter.
